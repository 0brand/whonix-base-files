 The Free Software Foundation has exempted Bash from the requirement of
 Paragraph 2c of the General Public License.  This is to say, there is
 no requirement for Bash to print a notice when it is started
 interactively in the usual way.  We made this exception because users
 and standards expect shells not to print such messages.  This
 exception applies to any program that serves as a shell and that is
 based primarily on Bash as opposed to other GNU software.
